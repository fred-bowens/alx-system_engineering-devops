The main role of a web server is to store, process, and deliver web content to clients (usually web browsers) over the internet using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol
A child process is a subprocess created by another process to perform tasks. It's a key concept in multitasking operating systems and is widely used for parallel processing, background work, and separating concerns in software applications.
Web servers typically use parent and child processes to improve performance, scalability, and reliability. This process-based architecture allows the server to handle multiple client requests concurrently, while maintaining control and stability.
The main HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS) define how a client interacts with a server. Each method has a specific role in CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is fundamental to how the web works.
